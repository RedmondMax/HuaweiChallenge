### Git

We use `git` to control the version and we have following conventions to keep our repository clean and tidy.

#### Branches Management

Each developer should work in their own branch. Except the `master`, all branches' name will be prefixed with `dev-` and concatenated with developers' name or functionalities.

Each developer should only have a master branch and your owning branches in local system.

Each developer should only `add` and `commit` to your own branches. If you need to merge it to `master`, please create a pull request on GitHub.
